# Vue Todo App

This is a simple todo app using Vue.js.

## Technologies

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Next Generation Frontend Tooling
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - The Progressive JavaScript Framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) - Tailwind Components

## Experience

- I started programming with React and had never used Vue.js before. I thought it would be a good idea to learn Vue.js by making a todo app with it.
- I have learned how to use Vue.js.

## Problems

- Lack of knowledge about Vue.js
- Lack of knowledge about Vue.js Props and Emit

## Change Log

- I created a new version because the UI of the previous one was not good enough. The new version has a better UI and better code structure.
