this is a simple elysia server with drizzle and postgresql database using docker for development and production

## Technologies

- [Elysia](https://elysiajs.com/) - Elysia is an ergonomic web framework for building backend servers with Bun.
- [Drizzle](https://drizzlejs.com/) - Drizzle is a simple and lightweight ORM
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - Open source relational database
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Containerization platform
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Typed JavaScript at Any Scale

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file

- `PORT` - Port number for the server to listen on
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL database connection string
- `POSTGRES_USER` - PostgreSQL database username
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` - PostgreSQL database password
- `POSTGRES_DB` - PostgreSQL database name

## Experience

- Elsia is a very interesting framework.
- It is very easy to learn and use because it is built on top of bun which mean it is very fast and lightweight and also very ergonomic like express.
- I also like the fact that it is very fast and lightweight. I will definitely use it again in the future.
- I started programming with express. So, I think elysia is a bit different from express. but not at all difficult to learn.
