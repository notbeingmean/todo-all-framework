# Node Http Todo App

This is a simple todo app that uses build-in node.js HTTP to create a simple server that can handle requests to create, read, update, and delete todos.

# Technologies

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/) - A simple ORM for Node.js.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - A powerful, open source object-relational database system.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - A platform for building, shipping, and running applications in containers.

# Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file

- `DATABASE_URL` - The URL to your PostgreSQL database
- `POSTGRES_DB` - The name of your postgresql database
- `POSTGRES_USER` - The username of your postgresql database
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` - The password of your postgresql database

# Exprience
