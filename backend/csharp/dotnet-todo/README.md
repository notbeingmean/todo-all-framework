## Experience

I had been study CSharp in university. But I had never built a project with .NET because I hate the oop concepts.
But I decided to build a project with .NET to learn how to use it.

## Problems

I had a problem with the database connection. I had to learn how to connect to the database with .NET. I had to learn how to use the `appsettings.json` file to configure the database connection.
I had a problem with the `DbContext` class. I had to learn how to use the `DbContext` class to interact with the database.
