# Spring Boot Todo

This is a simple todo application built with Spring Boot.

## Technologies

- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
- [Spring Data JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa)
- [Spring Web](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)

## Environment

- `POSTGRES_DB` - The name of the database
- `POSTGRES_USER` - The username of the database
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` - The password of the database
- `JDBC_DATABASE_URL` - The JDBC URL of the database

## Exprience

- I started programming with JavaSrcipt and I had never programming with Java before. I had to learn Java and Spring Boot from scratch. It would be better if I had more time to learn Java and Spring Boot

## Problems

- I had a problem with the database connection. I had to learn how to connect to the database with Spring Boot. I had to learn how to use the `application.properties` file to configure the database connection.
- I had a problem with the `@Entity` annotation. I had to learn how to use the `@Entity` annotation to create a table in the database.
